# Intelligent Road Repairing System

**A Machine Learning Project to identify objects and anomalies on
Indian roads using Indiaâ€™s traffic images and assess the quality of road
infrastructure based on satellite imaging (e.g. potholes on road, lane width,
pedestrian space, cycling lanes and tracks, road encroachments etc.).**


# Usage / Installation

This section will guide you through a series of steps to setup this project on your computer.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed to proceed further into the installation process

 - Python 3.5 (or above)
 - Python Package Manager - ( PIP )
 - Git 

##  Install Dependencies for the project

All the dependencies and Packages have been conveniently bundles into a 'requirements.txt' file for a smooth installation and have the Project Up and running on your machine with minimal effort and time.
Run the following commands from the terminal .

Get a complete copy of the project by cloning into a suitable directory

    git clone https://github.com/akhilgup/nitiayog_5.git
  
 Install all the dependencies by running the command from the terminal.

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

 - For training and subsequently generating the model, run the ```training.py``` file by the following command.
```
python training.py
```
This generates a model file ```mymodel.h5``` which is then used to give predictions.

-  For testing an image for giving predictions for the parameters ``` vehicles, potholes, traffic, pedestrian lanes, freeways/highways```,  place your image file in the same directory with the name ```test2.jpg``` and run the ```testing.py``` file by the following command 
```
python testing.py
```
The resultant output will be in the form of an image illustrating the Confidence of the model in the parameters listed above.

- Install the android app by downloading the apk from the repository or click here
> **Note :** The published APK has been tested on Android Platforms Marshmallow and below. There may be a compatibility issue for newer platforms.
- Run the website on your local-host by navigating to [Backend](https://github.com/akhilgup/nitiayog_5/tree/master/backend) and running the following command
```
python manage.py runserver
```

# Technical Details


## Training 

- The model is a result of **Convolutional Neural Network** with 2 Convolution Layers, 2 Pooling Layers applied with the **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)** activation function with **Filter Size of 5 ** along with Flatten Layer (Dense) made up of 500 neurons using **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)** as it's activation function. 

Training Parameters :-
``` 
EPOCHS = 30
INIT_LR = 1e-3 // Initial Learning Rate
BATCH_SIZE = 32
```
- Output Layer is Dense Layer consisting of neurons equal to the no. of target classes (5) using Softmax as it's activation function.
### Image Pre-Processing 
- All training images were scaled to 128 x 128 in Grayscale and all the pixels were feature scaled by dividing each pixel by 255.0. 
- Image generator function has been used to increase the training data by flipping, rotating images : [Keras Image PreProcessing](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/) .

## Results

**Validation Accuracy**: 89.7 % 
**Training Loss** : 0.2314
**Validation Loss** : 0.2514**
